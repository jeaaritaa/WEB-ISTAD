  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    Angkor Wat lies 5.5 kilometres (3+1‚ÅÑ2 mi) north
     of the modern town of Siem Reap, and a short 
     distance south and slightly east of the previous capital,
      which was centred at Baphuon. In an area of Cambodia where there 
      is an essential group of ancient structures, 
    it is the southernmost of Angkor's main sites
